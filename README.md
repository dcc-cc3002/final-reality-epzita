# Final Reality

Final Reality is a simplified clone of the renowned game, Final Fantasy. Its main purpose is to
serve as an educational tool, teaching foundational programming concepts.

This project follows an OOP design, implementing interfaces (traits) to describe the basic design of a class, an abstract class which implements most (if not all) methods of a class. 

This game currently has the core elements of an RPG game, with 5 different characters for you to choose; Warrior, Paladin, Ninja, Black Mage and White Mage. There is also a weapon mechanic for you to equip the one you think fits best for your character. 

As an RPG game, you can gather your party and fight your enemies in a turn-based combat implemented by a Turn Scheduler.

This project is currently in WIP.
